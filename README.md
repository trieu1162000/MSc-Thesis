# Implementation of Deep Learning Model on Low-Cost Embedded System (ARM Cortex-M)

This repository is part of my MSc thesis, focusing on deploying a YOLO-based deep learning model for object detection on low-cost microcontrollers, specifically the STM32H743 Nucleo board with ARM Cortex-M7 architecture.

## Target Hardware
- **Microcontroller:** STM32H743 Nucleo Board  
- **Architecture:** ARM Cortex-M7  

## Development Tools & Software
- **IDE & Deployment Tools:** STM32CubeIDE, X-Cube-AI  
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** Keras, TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), Darknet  

## Repository Structure

- **[`imgs/`](./imgs/)** — Contains images and diagrams used for documentation and visualization.
- **[`Srcs/`](./Srcs/)** — Contains source code for STM32 which was configured and generated by STM32 Cube IDE.
- **[`Docs/`](./Docs/)** — Includes documentation, tutorials, and references for deploying ML/DL on ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.  
- **[`Dataset/`](./Dataset/)** — Stores datasets used for training and evaluation.  
- **[`cfgs/`](./cfgs/)** — Configuration files for the deep learning model, including network architecture and inference settings.  
- **[`Demo/`](./Demo/)** — Contains parsing scripts and example applications to test the deployed model on STM32.
